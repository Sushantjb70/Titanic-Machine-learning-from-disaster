# Titanic-Machine-learning-from-disaster
In this, we will do the the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

All the steps have been mentioned in the `Titanic.ipynb` file.
Just execute the code stepwise in Jupyter notebook.


The packages required are:
1)Pandas
2)seaborn
3)numpy
4)random
5)matplotlib
6)sklearn


Data for this project is available in the repository as "test.csv" and "train.csv"

The final results are saved in "submission.csv" file.
The output is stored as 0 and 1 i.e not survived and survived respectively.
